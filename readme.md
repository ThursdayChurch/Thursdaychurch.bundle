This is a Plex channel that can pull your favorite webisodes on it.

It can pull shows with available Plex URL services that are RSS feeds, from Vimeo or YouTube.

It requires a specific structure of the shows URL. Please see the notes below.

NOTES AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS CHANNEL

With this channel you can add shows from all the sources listed.  I have also added a "Channel Tools" section with some additional tools that can be useful including resetting the shows to the default in case you have any problems, instructions for Roku users. 

RSS feeds seems to work for any RSS feed, I have tested so far, as long as there is already a Plex URL service for the website or direct links to the video files (like .mp4) are in the feed. So you cannot enter a URL, for example, your local news station unless someone has created a URL service for it or the feed include direct video file links. With the Firefox browser, an RSS Feed with a direct link to the media files will have a title of "Media file" with the media file listed below. Media listed in the XML code as enclosure or media:content URL are recognized by the channel code.The channel can support RSS feed that show a media file of type mp3, m4a, mp4, and flv. Examples of RSS feeds that has media files and provides direct access to the video files are http://thebrowncast.libsyn.com/rss and http://feeds.feedbur...arge?format=xml.  The channel has a built in function that will check the media in the RSS feed. If there is no URL service or media files in the RSS feed, the entry will be listed as "No URL Service or Media Files for Entry,".

To add a new show to sections of the Webisode channel, other than the RSS feed, you just need to enter the name or id of the show. For example to add the show High Maintenance to the Vimeo section, you would just type in "High Maintenance". For the YouTube section,you would enter the playlist id, channel id, or user name. You must include the PL at the beginning of playlist and UC at the beginning of channel ids for them to be recognized. For a playlist from Youtube with a url of https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4F5986B34F73F112, you would only need to enter "PL4F5986B34F73F112" or for a user account like http://www.youtube.com/user/NewarkTimesWeddings, you would just enter the user name NewarkTimesWeddings.

If you are having issues with a show not being recognized or returning as invalid using the method above, you can instead enter the full url address for the show. The format for the URL to be entered is given below and usually follows the URL address given in your browsers address bar:

YOUTUBE
Examples:
Playlist url: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl4T6p7km9dbx0o8J35KjWAwaiEo5tV7G
User upload url: http://www.youtube.com/user/NewarkTimesWeddings

VIMEO
Example: http://vimeo.com/highmaintenance

RSS FEEDS

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROKU USERS:

YOU MUST USE THE CLASSIC VERSION TO ADD SHOWS. Currently adding shows to the Webisode channel requires you to use the Classic version of the Plex app for Roku. Access to input options for channels are not yet available for the current the Plex app for Roku. Though you must use the Classic version to add shows, feed. etc. Once a new item is added, you can view and watch all videos for that item using the current version.

A LINK TO THE REMOKU WEB BASED REMOTE CONTROL AT http://remoku.tv/ MAKES INPUT OF URLS VERY EASY. LINK IT TO THE ADDRESS OF YOUR ROKU MACHINE. MORE INFO IS AVAILABLE AT http://forums.roku.c...p?f=28&t=46852. ONCE YOU HAVE REMOKU RUNNING IN YOUR BROWSER, YOU CAN THEN CAN COPY AND PASTE THE URL ADDRESS INTO THE REMOKU DIRECTLY INTO THE ADD CHANNEL USER ENTRY.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR Plex/Web USERS:

PLEX/WEB (AKA MEDIA MANAGER) DOES NOT ALLOW USER INPUT SO IT WILL NOT SHOW THE ADD SHOW BUTTONS. THEREFORE YOU CANNOT ADD ANY SHOWS USING PLEX/WEB. DUE TO UPDATES TO THE CLIENT, THE ABILITY TO ADD SHOWS WITH THE NEW INTERFACE'S SEARCH DIALOG BOX NO LONGER WORKS.

THE PLEX/WEB INTERFACE WILL ONLY UPDATE ONCE A DAY UNLESS YOU CLEAR YOUR CACHE. SO CHANGES MADE IN THE PLEX/WEB INTERFACE WILL BE SEEN IMMEDIATELY IN OTHER CLIENTS BUT WILL TAKE A DAY TO SHOW UP IN THE PLEX/WEB INTERFACE UNLESS THE CACHE IS CLEARED.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ADVANCED USERS:
WARNING: PLEASE MAKE BACKUPS BEFORE EDITING ANY FILES. CHOOSING TO EDIT THESE FILES CAN COMPLETELY BREAK THE CHANNEL, SO CHOOSING TO DO SO IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM UNABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE IF THESE FILES BECOME CORRUPTED.
For those who may decide to edit the json data file attached to this channel to add shows there are a few things to keep in mind. It pulls the original list of shows from a JSON data file but then saves that list to a local dictionary file. So you can add the necessary data for the show to the JSON file but would then need to click the Reset Shows button in the Channel Tools section for it to accept these changes. 
The Dict[] file for the channel is located in the /Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Data/com.plexapp.plugins.webisodes/ folder. If the channel becomes corrupt you will have to delete that file to reinstall the channel. 
And the numbering system must stay intact, so never completely delete an entry from the json file, just remove or add the data in the specific entry fields you want to add or delete.
